# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, June 14, 2017
###### # Preparing [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) Challenge
**Today's Progress**: Set things to do in this challenge: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - [Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map).
**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is my very first gateway to Web Development. As a (Desktop) Software Engineer, I hope getting certificate from freeCodeCamp can make me pursue my interest in Web Development.

### Day 1: Thursday, June 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Half-finished my Tribute Page for [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).
**Thoughts:** This is my first day of the challenge and I already struggled with CSS and Bootstrap when tried to finish my Tribute Page. Honestly, I coded my Tribute Page based on the example provided by freeCodeCamp and it used Bootstrap 3. I went with Bootstrap 4 at first, but felt really confused because what I coded was not same with the example. So, I decided to use Bootstrap 3 and managed to get my Tribute Page half-finished.
Quote for today: "There is always a first time for everything."
