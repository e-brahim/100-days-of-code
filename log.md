# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday, June 14, 2017

###### # Preparing [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Set things to do in this challenge: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - [Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map).

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is my very first gateway to Web Development. As a (Desktop) Software Engineer, I hope getting certificate from freeCodeCamp can make me pursue my interest in Web Development.

### Day 1: Thursday, June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half-finished my Tribute Page for [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

**Thoughts:** This is my first day of the challenge and I already struggled with CSS and Bootstrap when tried to finish my Tribute Page. Honestly, I coded my Tribute Page based on the example provided by freeCodeCamp and it used Bootstrap 3. I went with Bootstrap 4 at first, but felt really confused because what I coded was not same with the example. So, I decided to use Bootstrap 3 and managed to get my Tribute Page half-finished.

### Day 2: Friday, June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Tribute Page for [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

**Thoughts:** This is the easy part of the page, but need a lot of time to code. Can not wait for Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage Challenge.

### Day 3: Saturday, June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took my first step into building a Personal Portfolio Webpage for [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage). Finished building my own vertical sticky navigation bar with a few things to do left.

**Thoughts:** First step is always hard. Why did the link text still be underlined even though the text-decoration property has been set to 'none'?

**Today's Progress**: Tried [TOP CAREER CODE CHALLENGE SUMMER 2017](http://www.topcareer.jp/inter/code2017/). Revisited Java: Iterator, Date, Time, String, Regex/

**Thoughts:** Realized that I am very far away from competitive programming.

### Day 5: Monday, June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned fun stuffs from reworking navigation bar on my Portfolio Page. Next: Make it responsive and dive into design and contents.

**Thoughts:** Finally, I fixed the "underlined issue". Excited when (just) found this great resource of web development: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/.
