# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0: Wednesday, June 14, 2017
###### # Preparing [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) Challenge
**Today's Progress**: Set things to do in this challenge: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - [Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map).
**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is my very first gateway to Web Development. As a (Desktop) Software Engineer, I hope getting certificate from freeCodeCamp can make me pursue my interest in Web Development.
